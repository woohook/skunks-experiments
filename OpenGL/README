These files require SDL 1.2. You should try
to use them only if the software rendering
is too slow on your computer. If you really
want OpenGL, copy these files into the main
directory and compile with "./comp-gl".

Don't expect them to work though, since
OpenGL and 3D acceleration in general don't
function properly on most computers.
